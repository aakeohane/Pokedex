# Pokedex
* A small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail through a modal. I used a bootstrap framework for formatting the UI

1) Project description
2) How to get the project running
3) Project dependencies (e.g., JavaScript version, ESLint rules)
4) Which API the project uses
