- A modal is used to show additional details about the Pokemon you clicked on

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to view a Pokédex and see more data for a particular Pokémon on request
2. As a user, I want to be able to see information about a Pokémon quickly with a simple and minimilist interface
3. As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific Pokémon

## Technologies

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Kanban ([Trello](https://trello.com/))

## Final Reflections

<!-- - Write about some difficulties and solutions like how I was able to find the error without using a linter (used repl it)
- why i used jQuery in some areas of code rather than vanilla JS (faster search features)
- used kanban board to keep me on schedule -->
